                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>I'm Zeyi Chen, a passionate full-stack developer with a keen eye for design and a love for building intuitive, user-friendly applications. With over 5 years of experience in web development, I've worked on a variety of projects from small business websites to complex enterprise applications.</p>
                
                <p>I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating applications that not only look great but also provide exceptional user experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with new development technologies.</p>
                
                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>I approach each project with a focus on simplicity, functionality, and user experience. I believe that the best solutions are often the simplest ones, and I strive to find the perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality in every project I work on.</p>
